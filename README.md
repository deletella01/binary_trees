## C - Binary trees

A binary tree is a k-ary k=2 tree data structure in which each node has at most tw children, which are referred to as the left child and the right child.
Binary Tree is a special datastructure used for data storage purposes. A binary tree has a special condition that each node can have a maximum of two children. A binary tree has the benefits of both an ordered array and a linked list as search is as quick as in a sorted array and insertion or deletion operation are as fast as in linked list.

Important Terms:
Following are the important terms with respect to tree:-

-Path: Path refers to the sequence of nodes along the edges of a tree.

-Root: The node at the top of the tree is called root. There is only one root per tree and one path from the root node to any node.

-Parent: Any node except the root node has one edge upward to a node called parent.

-Child: The node below a given node connected by its edge downward is called its child node.

-Leaf: The node which does not have any child node is called the leaf node.

-Subtree: Subtree represents the descendants of a node.

-Visiting: Visiting refers to checking the value of a node when control is on the node.

-Traversing: Traversing means passing through nodes in a specific order.

-Levels: Level of a node represents the generation of a node. If the root node is at level 0, then its next child node is at level 1, its grandchild is at level 2, and so on.

-Keys: Key represents a value of a node based on which a search operation is to be carried out for a node.

### Binary Search Tree Representation
Binary Search tree exhibits a special behavior. A node's left child must have a value less than its parent's value and the node's right child must have a value greater than its parent value.
